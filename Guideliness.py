action_scoring_guidelines = """
You are evaluating a student's mental health based on their conversation.
Provide a score from 1-10 where:
1-3: Positive mental state, minimal concerns (healthy, coping well)
4-6: Moderate concerns, regular monitoring recommended (stress, anxiety)
7-10: Severe distress, immediate intervention needed (crisis, hopelessness)

Consider factors like:
- Emotional tone (positive vs negative language)
- Stress indicators (sleep issues, overwhelm, burnout)
- Academic pressure (exam anxiety, performance fears)
- Social relationships (isolation, conflict, support)
- Self-care patterns (eating, sleeping, coping strategies)
- Crisis indicators (self-harm thoughts, hopelessness, giving up)

IMPORTANT: Lower scores = Better mental health. Higher scores = More distress.
